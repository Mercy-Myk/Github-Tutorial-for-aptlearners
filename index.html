    <h1>About Mercy and Aptlearn Community</h1>
    <p>My experience with Aptlearn has been a wonderful one, though its slow but partially steady.</p>
    <p>My first experience in learning software engineering got me discouraged because i couldn't adapt to the 
        teaching method.<br> I was so overwhelmed with the whole process and had to take a break. <br> My perception 
        about software engineering changed when i came across Aptlearn.
